--- Original Description ---
Sorry guys, can't update anytime soon.

Hello and welcome to Star Trek: Federation.

This mod essentially covers technologies from the late 24th centuries. I have included DS9 style uniforms, cold weather field jackets, and phasers covering a number of different periods. The plans and goals for this mod are to include more research fields, more buildings for federation flair, expanded races to include other federation races, and more technology to bring the star trek feel to the game. Please let me know if you think of anything you might want to see. :)


To be done

--Expanded uniform base for federation characters (Late 24th century)
--Add federation backstories and traits.

Interested in my other mods?
-Borg Race/Faction 
-Dune - Fremen Faction
-WWII Red Army - Soviet Faction
-WWII Wehrmacht - German Faction
-Napoleonic Age - France/Britain/Prussia


Let me know if you think of anything you'd like to see. You can also join the borg discussion on discord at the Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 discord channel

Thanks to Thirite and Erdelf for all their help. :)</description>
